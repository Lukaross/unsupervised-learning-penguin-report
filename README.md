# unsupervised-learning-penguin-report
A report in which I analyse an Antarctic penguin data set using unsupervised learning

This coursework is about analysing a biological data set containing size and weight measurements for
333 adult penguins near Palmer Station, Antarctica.

I used K-means and Hierarchical clustering to analyse the data and visulsed the results.
